# FireSight YOLO: Wildfire Detection Using AI
A Proposed Framework for Wildfire Detection Using AI

Early detection of fire and smoke is critical for safety in industrial, residential and environmental monitoring. Traditional methods rely on manual surveillance/basic image processing, which lack accuracy in complex scenarios. This project developed an automated detection system combining YOLOv8's realtime object detection with machine learning classifiers - Logistic Regression for interpretable baseline results and K-Nearest Neighbors to capture complex patterns - creating  hybrid solution that leverages cutting-edge computer vision while maintaining computational efficiency for practical deployment
